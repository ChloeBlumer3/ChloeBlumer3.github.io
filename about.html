  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p><strong>Chloe Blumer</strong></p>

  <p>
    Hello! My name is Chloe Blumer, and I am a student interested in how artificial
    intelligence is shaping modern technology and society. This newsletter was created
    for my CAH 205 course and focuses on the role of AI in modern vehicles, including
    driver-assistance systems, safety considerations, and ethical concerns.

  <p>
    This page serves as a brief introduction, and the content may be updated as my
    research and interests continue to develop.
