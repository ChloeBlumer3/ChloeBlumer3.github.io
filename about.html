        Hello! My name is Chloe, I am a student interested in how emerging technologies shape everyday life,
        particularly in the transportation industry. This newsletter was created as
        part of my coursework to explore how artificial intelligence is being applied
        in modern vehicles.
      </p>

      <p>
        My focus is on real-world AI systems that are shaping the automotive industry with
        attention to safety, regulation, and how different companies approach
        automation. By comparing industry strategies, I aim to better understand how
        applied AI impacts both innovation and public trust.
