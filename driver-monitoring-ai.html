      <p class="post-date">February 4, 2026</p>

      <p>
        As driver-assistance systems become more advanced, ensuring that drivers remain
        attentive has become a major safety concern. Many modern vehicles now rely on
        artificial intelligence to monitor driver behavior, detecting signs of
        distraction, fatigue, or inattention.
      </p>

      <h2>How Driver Monitoring Systems Work</h2>
      <p>
        AI driver monitoring systems use in-cabin cameras and sensors to track eye
        movement, head position, and facial behavior. These systems analyze patterns to
        determine whether a driver is attentive or at risk.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Driver Attention Matters in AI-Assisted Driving</h2>
      <p>
        Driver-assistance technology still requires human oversight. AI monitoring helps
        ensure drivers remain ready to intervene during complex or unexpected driving
        situations.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitations and Concerns</h2>
      <p>
        While effective, these systems raise concerns related to privacy, false alerts,
        and inconsistent implementation across automakers.
      </p>

      <h2>The Role of AI in Improving Road Safety</h2>
      <p>
        By detecting fatigue and distraction early, AI monitoring systems help prevent
        accidents and support responsible use of automation on the road.
